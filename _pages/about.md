I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Princeton University, where I work with Dr. [Naomi Leonard](https://naomi.princeton.edu/). I completed my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2020 at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Dr. [Magnus Egerstedt](http://magnus.ece.gatech.edu/). My research focuses on the distributed coordination of multi-robot systems, with a particular focus on modeling heterogeneous capabilities within large swarms of robots. I am also very interested on exploring how to use swarm robotics in various forms of artistic expression, research for which I was awarded a [La Caixa Fellowship for Graduate Studies in North America](https://obrasociallacaixa.org/en/investigacion-y-becas/becas-de-la-caixa/posgrado-en-america-del-norte-y-asia-pacifico/descripcion-del-programa) during my doctoral studies. 

I am originally from Caldas de Reis, Galicia, Spain. Before starting my PhD journey, I received a degree in Industrial Engineering (Ingeniera Industrial), specializing in Automation and Electronics, in 2013 and an M.S. in Advanced Industrial Processes and Technologies in 2014, both from the University of Vigo (Vigo, Spain). I also received a Professional Degree in Music, specializing in Violin, from the Manuel Quiroga Conservatory of Music in Pontevedra, Spain, in 2012. I obtained a M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2016 as a [Fulbright scholar](https://fulbright.es/).   

When I am not in the lab, you can probably find me playing the violin with friends (beware, sometimes I even try to sing), practicing ashtanga yoga or learning some latin dance moves. If you cannot find me, I am probably off on some travel adventure.
