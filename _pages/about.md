I am a PhD Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech, where I work with  Dr. [Magnus Egerstedt](http://magnus.ece.gatech.edu/) in the [GRITS Lab](http://gritslab.gatech.edu/home/). My research focuses on the distributed coordination of multi-robot systems, with a particular focus on modeling heterogeneous capabilities within large swarms of robots. I am also very interested on exploring how to use swarm robotics in various forms of artistic expositions. 

Before starting my PhD journey, I received a degree in Industrial Engineering (Ingeniero Industrial) degree in 2013 and an M.S. in Advanced Industrial Processes and Technologies Research in 2014, both from the University of Vigo (Vigo, Spain). I also received a Professional Degree in Music, specializing in Violin, from the Manuel Quiroga Conservatory of Music in Pontevedra, Spain in 2012. I obtained a M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2016 as a Fulbright scholar.   

When I am not in the lab, you can probably find me playing the violin with friends (beware, sometimes I even try to sing), practicing ashtanga yoga or learning some latin dance moves. If you cannot find me, I am probably off to some travel adventure.
