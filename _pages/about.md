I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Princeton University, where I work with Dr. [Naomi Leonard](https://naomi.princeton.edu/). My research focuses on the modeling, analysis, and implementation of scalable algorithms for multi-robot systems to accomplish complex tasks through local interactions. I am particularly interested in problems involving heterogeneous capabilities or strategies at the agent level, as well as the execution of dynamic or undefined tasks. To this end, I utilize concepts from control theory, robotics, optimization, and machine learning.

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2020, advised by Dr. [Magnus Egerstedt](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/magnus-egerstedt). My doctoral research was partially supported by a fellowship from La Caixa Foundation. Prior to that, I completed a M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology as a Fulbright scholar in 2016 and a B.S/M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Vigo in 2013, for which I was awarded Outstanding Graduate of the Year (Premio Fin de Carrera).

When I am not in the lab, you can find me playing the violin with friends (beware, sometimes I even try to sing), dancing to latin music, or practicing yoga.
